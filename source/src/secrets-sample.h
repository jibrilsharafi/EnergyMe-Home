/*
This is a sample secrets file for the EnergyMe Home project. 
It contains constants for connecting to an MQTT broker and publishing data.
While it was originally created for connecting to AWS IoT Core, it can be
modified to work with other MQTT brokers.

The AWS_IOT_CORE_MQTT_ENDPOINT and AWS_IOT_CORE_PORT constants are the address and port of the 
MQTT broker.

The MQTT_BASIC_INGEST, MQTT_TOPIC_1, and MQTT_TOPIC_2 constants form the basic 
structure of the MQTT topics that the device will publish to.

The MQTT_RULE_NAME_* and MQTT_TOPIC_* constants are used to construct the MQTT 
topics for different types of data (Meter, Status, Metadata, Channel, General 
Configuration). Each MQTT_RULE_NAME_* should be replaced with the appropriate 
rule name for the corresponding type of data. You can also see this just as 
a way to differentiate the topics.

The final topic will be:
"{MQTT_BASIC_INGEST}/{MQTT_RULE_NAME_*}/{MQTT_TOPIC_1}/{MQTT_TOPIC_2}/{MQTT_TOPIC_*}"

The aws_iot_core_cert_ca, aws_iot_core_cert_crt, and aws_iot_core_cert_private constants are the 
certificates used for TLS encryption. They should be replaced with your 
actual certificates.

To use this file, replace all the placeholders (REPLACE_WITH_MQTT_ENDPOINT, XXX) 
with your actual values, and rename the file to secrets.h.
